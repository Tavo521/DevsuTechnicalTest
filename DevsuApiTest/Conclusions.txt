In my experience with API testing using the Karate framework, I realized that breaking down tasks step by step is key. I made sure all the required objectives were met by setting up a smart system where all tests run together smoothly, saving time compared to doing them one by one. I also made things faster by running multiple tests at the same time, keeping everything neat and tidy.

My goal was not just to get things done efficiently, but to make testing easier for everyone. By making tests run together and speeding up the whole process.
