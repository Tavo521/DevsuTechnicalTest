One of the most challenging aspects of the technical exercise was dealing with popups (alerts) that appear when adding a new product. Handling these alerts posed a difficulty because Serenity didn't provide a specific method for managing the driver in this scenario. To overcome this hurdle, a custom method was meticulously crafted using Selenium. By implementing a try-catch approach and leveraging driver methods, we successfully navigated the complexities of the alert, ensuring the seamless continuation of the test.
